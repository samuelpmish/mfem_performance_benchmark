This directory contains modifications of the example codes that illustrate the
use of MFEM features based on the Caliper performance profiling library.

To build these examples, make sure that MFEM is configured with the option
"MFEM_USE_CALIPER = YES", see the top-level INSTALL file for details (version
2.5.0 of Caliper is recommended, though older versions may work too).

We recommend comparing the original example codes with the corresponding files
in the current directory.
