This directory contains modifications of the example codes that illustrate the
use of MFEM features based on the Parallel Unstructured Mesh Infrastructure,
PUMI, from https://scorec.rpi.edu/pumi.

To build these examples, make sure that MFEM is configured with the option
"MFEM_USE_PUMI = YES", see the top-level INSTALL file for details.

We recommend comparing the original example codes with the corresponding files
in the current directory.
