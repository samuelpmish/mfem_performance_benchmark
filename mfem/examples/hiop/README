This directory contains modifications of the example codes that illustrate the
use of MFEM for solving nonlinear constrained optimization problems, including
features based on the HiOp, a lightweight HPC solver for nonlinear optimization
problems.

To use the HiOp features, make sure that MFEM is configured with the option
"MFEM_USE_HIOP = YES", see the top-level INSTALL file for details.

We recommend comparing the original example codes with the corresponding files
in the current directory.
